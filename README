DSPAM
=====

DSPAM spam filter from the EPEL repository. Current version 3.10.2

Instructions: Download and run dspam-install.sh
Usage: CentOS/RHEL[5,6,7]
Deployment:
1) Validate existing, or Install of, running MySQL/MariaDB server;
2) Remove any existing DSPAM database;
3) Create new empty DSPAM database;
4) Install yum priorities 
5) Install EPEL repository;
6) Install dspam, dspam-client, and dspam-mysql from this repo;
7) Change permission on '/var/run/dspam'; 
8) Move old '/etc/dspam.conf' to '/etc/dspam.conf.bak' 
   and copy new dspam/dspam.conf to '/etc/dspam.conf';
9) Give the option to copy the old '~/mydomain.com/.qmail-default' to 
   '~/mydomain.com/.qmail-default.bak' and copy new 'dspam/.qmail-default' to
   '~/mydomain.com/.qmail-default'

After this procedure is complete a DSPAM tag should be present in every email
header for the chosen domains. The DSPAM tags in the email header take the 
following form:

X-DSPAM-Result: Whitelisted
X-DSPAM-Processed: Wed Jan 29 15:54:00 2014
X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.9979
X-DSPAM-Improbability: 1 in 47847 chance of being spam
X-DSPAM-Probability: 0.0000
X-DSPAM-Signature: 1,52e9868836001165617631

For training I create a '.spam' and '.notspam' directory for every IMAP user and 
train DSPAM on the email in these folders. I've never had to train any ham. DSPAM
works well for me without doing so. As of this README training with Outlook 2013
is difficult since it strips necessary information from the email header when 
moving it from one IMAP folder to another, particularly from the INBOX to the 
spam folder.

The '.spam' folder is where users are to put spam marked as innocent.
The '.notspam' folder is where users are to put ham marked as spam.

The bread and butter of my success with dspam is training only email
that has a dspam header. I do not train corpus and have had little success
and many problems (false positives) doing so. I train only email that is
spam but that has been tagged by dspam as innocent. The heart of all my
bash scripts, whether training bulk or individual email,is the 
following call to dspam:

cat $email | dspam --user user@domain --mode=teft --class=spam --source=error

I also strip the spamassassin header in training so the complete call is as follows:

cat $email | sed 's/\*\*\*SPAM\*\*\*//g' | dspam --user user@domain --mode=teft --class=spam --source=error
